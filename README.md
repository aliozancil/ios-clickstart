This is a quick start project for iOS with automated unit testing, 
a jenkins build and a backend service using CouchDB. 
Intended to be used as a "seed" for common database backed iOS apps.

You don't have to use all of it, just press the button, get your own version of it going, and go from there.


Press the big button to continue:

Once it is running - it will tell you what to do next to make it your own.
